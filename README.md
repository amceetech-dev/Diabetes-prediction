# Diabetes-prediction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes. By analyzing various health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, and other factors, the model can provide a prediction about whether a person is diabetic or not.
